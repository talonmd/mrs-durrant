          <h3>What is The 40 Book Challenge?</h3>
          <p>The idea for the 40 Book Challenge originated from a wonderful book that I read called <em>The Book Whisperer</em> by Donalyn Miller. This challenge encourages students to choose books in a variety of genres and to find books that appeal to them and make reading enjoyable.</p>
          <h3>How Students Can Participate</h3>
          <p>
            Our participation in the challenge is at an individual and a class level with rewards to be earned as they progress. Students log books read by recording the title, author, and number of pages. Books need to be at least 100 pages in length. I give credit for two books if a book has over 300 pages and three books if a book has over 600 pages and so on (I want to encourage those who are already challenging themselves with longer books). Students log books in a notebook that is kept at school and sign off books read with me.
          </p>
          <h3>How Parents Can Help</h3>
          <p>
            Your encouragement and support of their reading is appreciated. Please remind them to write down information from the books they may be reading at home so that they can get credit for them as part of our challenge.

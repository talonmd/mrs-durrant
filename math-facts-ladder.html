          <h3>What is The Math Facts Ladder?</h3>
          <p>
            A ready knowledge of math facts is an essential foundation students must have to access the fifth grade math curriculum. Students climb the Math Fact Ladder by passing off their times tables section by section and earning incentives along the way. This is a great review for those who may already have mastered their times tables as well as an incentive for those who need some practice. Students are encouraged to complete their climb early in the year, but progress is celebrated whenever it may come.

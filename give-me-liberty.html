          <h3>What is Give Me Liberty?</h3>
          <p>
            Our students have the opportunity to participate in a patriotic enrichment program offered to fifth grade students in our state. Our <strong>Give Me Liberty</strong> program is sponsored
            by an organization called United We Pledge. The link below will take you to their site, where you can download/view a digital copy of the same booklet that your student will receive here
            at school. Students participating in this program will work on passing off requirements throughout the year related to citizenship.
          </p>

            I pledge allegiance to the Flag <br />
            of the United States of America and <br />
            to the Republic for which it stands, <br />
            one Nation under God, indivisible, <br />

          <p>
            Oh! say can you see, by the dawn's early light, <br />
            What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's <br />
            last gleaming? <br />
            Whose broad stripes and bright stars, <br />
            through the perilous fight <br />
            O'er the ramparts we watched, <br />
            were so gallantly streaming? <br />
            And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, <br />
            Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. <br />
            Oh! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave <br />
            O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
          </p>

          <h4 id="gettysburg">The Gettysburg Address</h4>
          <p><em>Recite all at one time (7 helps)</em></p>
          <p>"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
          <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.</p>
          <p>
            We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live.
          </p>
          <p>It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
          <p>
            But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor
            power to add or detract.
          </p>
          <p>The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.</p>
          <p>
            It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
            great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve
            that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
            perish from the earth."

          <h3>What is Give Me Liberty?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Give Me Liberty</em></strong> is a program offered to fifth grade students in the state of Utah that we participate in here at our school. <strong><em>Give Me Liberty</em></strong> is a patriotic enrichment program that helps familiarize students with national and state symbols, national songs and documents, as well as the American states and presidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are twelve requirements to be passed off in order to qualify for the <strong><em>Give Me Liberty</em></strong> award which will be given out at the end of the year. Other incentives are given for some of the more challenging requirements and there are two incentive parties throughout the year that students earn by passing off a certain number of requirements by the designated deadline dates. The fifth grade year culminates in a <strong><em>Give Me Liberty</em></strong> program performance in May which parents are invited to attend.
          </p>
          <h3>What are the Requirements?</h3>
          <p>The requirements are listed below with links to practice aids. Students have books that they will keep at school to track their progress in. Students must pass requirements off at school with a teacher, but we welcome your encouragement and support of your students efforts to meet their individual goals.</p>
